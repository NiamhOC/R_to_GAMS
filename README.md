# R_to_GAMS
This repository contains fuctions to facilitate the transfer of data between R and GAMS through the creation and reading of GDX files. 
A sample project is included to illustrate the operation of the developed functions.
The functions have been developed in collaboration with Javier Saez Gallego.
